Stream:
    Retention period of 24h
    Tha capacity of your stream will be a function of numbers of shards. To increase or decrease stream capacity, you can increase or descrease number of shards.
    Shard:
        - is an unique sequence of records in a stream
        - Each shard supports 5 transactions per second for read and 1000  per second for write
        - Each shard supports total read rate of 2MB per second and 1MB per second for write

    Partition Key:
        - Is used to group data by shard within stream
    
    Sequence Number:
        - Each data has a sequence number thas is UNIQUE per PARTITION-KEY in shard
    
    Consumer:
        - Gets records from AWS Kinesis Data Streams and process them. Known as Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Application

    Kinesis Firehouse:
        - Dont manage the underlynig infrastructure and the shards
        - Just need a data source that can put the data into Firehouse delivey stream

        Data Producer:
            - Send records to Kinesis Data Firehouse delivery streams
            - You can also congfigure Firehouse delivery stream to read data from existing Kinesis data stream and load to destinations
        Record:
            - Each record can't exceeds 1000kb (1MB)
        
        Destinations:
            - S3
            - Redshift
            - Elasticsearch
            - Splunk
            - Datadog
            - Dynatrace
            - LogicMonitor
            - MongoDB
            - New Relic
            - Sumo Logic
