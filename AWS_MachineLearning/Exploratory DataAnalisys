Pandas:
    - Explore data
    - Manipulate the data

Numpy:
    - Work with arrays
    - Interages with pandas dataframes

Matplotlib:
    - Data Visualisation
    - Boxplot is a simple way to see how your data is distribuited and how many outliers you might have
    - Histogram  

Seaborn: pretty charts and graphs
    - More flexible data plot
    - Heat map represents the average values at each point there. ntuitive fell how often different datapoints appear in different combination of categories
    - Pairplot plots every kind of combinatio of attributes all at once
    - Jointplot combine the scatter plot with histograms on each axis

Scikit-learn:
    - Focus on ML algoriths and models such as regrassion, neural network, classifications...
    - Can provide some pre-processing functions and methods

Data Types:
    - Numerical: Represents a quantitative measure, something wich can be measured. Could assume discrete or continuous data.
    - Categorical data: Represents qualitative data wich has no mathematical meaning. Could assume numbers or letter.
    - Ordinal: Mixture of numerical and categorical, like a film scale or an evaluation of something.


Data distribuition:
    - Normal distribuition(Gauss distribution)
    - Probability Mass Function seems like normal distribution but for discrete values
    - Poisson distribution wokrs with discrete data
    - Binomial distributions discrete distribution, used for binari data like negative or positive, true or false
    - Bernoulli distribution, is a especial case on binomial but just a single trial
