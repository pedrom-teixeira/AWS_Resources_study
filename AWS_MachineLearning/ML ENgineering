Feature:
    - Is what i know about my data and it will be used to the training model
    - Too many features is problematic. It's harder to find the optimal solution
    - Ones of MAchine learning jobs is to choose the best features

Missing Data:
    - Replace the missing values with the mean value from the rest of the column.
    - To outliers value treatment, a median imputation. It's not the better choice and it's works only in column level, ignoring correlations.
    - It could be excluded is there aren't many NA data ! Caution to do not bias your data droppping missing values. An option it's to subtitute to a similar field
    - KNN uses machinelearning itself to fill missingdata. It assumes only numerical data.
    - Deep Learning to impute data. Works wll for categorical but it's complicated
    - Regression to find relationships between the missing feature and others
    - MICE is one of the best  techniques to input missing data (advanced)
    - Other good option is collect more data

Unbalance data (quantity):
    - Oversampling data of minority class, coping this cases
    - Undersampling, removing de maiority cases. Just can be use to avoid scalling hardware. Is not the better approach
    - Smote (synthetic monority oversampling). It' generates artificials samples of minority classes using KNN
    - Adjusting threshlhold of sample sorting when generating the sample.


Outliers:
    - Variance measures how spread-ou the data is. Calculates as the average of the squared differenfes between values and the mean
    - STD Deviation calculated as squared root of variance. Identifies outliers like "F is two standard deviations away from the mean"
