 
EC2 Definition/Introduction: 
  - EC2 instances it are similar to Virtual Machines
  - Stop or terminated instances are not paid
  - EC2 instances could be configurated as Windows or Linux operational systems
  - EC2 instances are resizeable (Vertical Scalling)
  - For traditional applications, full access to OS
  - EC2 Instance connect is a browser-based client with you can use to connect instance to MAC, Linux or Windows OS.
  
EC2 Placement groups:
  - Cluster: Closest instances -> low latency, high workload, HPC
  - Partition: distribute instances by partitions, so that each partition do not share hardware -> distribuited workload, Hadoop, big data, kafka
  - Spread: Spread the instances -> critic workload, fault reduction
  
  
  EC2 Instances types and characteristic:
  - Instaces types are combined on severous CPU, memory, storage and network capacity
  - Distributed on General propose, Compute optmized, Memory opmized, Accelerated computing and Storage optmized
  
General purpose instances provide a good balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads like web service or code repositories. 

Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-intensive tasks like gaming servers, high performance computing or HPC, and even scientific modeling. 

Accelerated computing are good for floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, as they use hardware accelerators. 

Storage optimized are good for, can you guess it? Workloads that require high performance for locally stored data.

  ELB (Elastic Load Balancing):
  - Runs at Region level
  - Handle the traffic between online instances
  - ELB turns on offline instances, when the load is full and vice versa
  - best suited for HTTP and HTTPS traffic
  - High availability and fault tolerance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elastic Beanstalk:
  - Helps EC2 to build an environment and made it easily replicable 
  - Need to provide the aplication code and desired configuration
  - Not have to manage all separately
  - Allows to focus on the business application, not on infrastructure
  -  deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers
  - 
  
  Adjust capacity
  Load balancing
  Automatic scaling
  Application health monitoring
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CloudFormation:
  - Infrastructure as code
  - allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, all the resources needed for your applications across all Regions and accounts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lightsail: Virtual private service
  - Easy to configure
  - Useful to websites, business softwares, dev and tests environment
  - It's a server for simple applications
  - User friendly
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ECS/EKS:
  - Containers orchertrations tool
  - Useful for microservices, batch workloads, docker containers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto Scaling:
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Can be configured by Launch configuration (legado) ou Launch template
  - High avaliability
  - Span trhough avaliability zones
  - Free to use
  - Scales In
  - Scales out
  - Do not scales down or up (upgrade to a more powerfull EC2 instances)
  
  Scalling types:
    - Manual
    - Dynamic allows to scale using cloudwatch alarms trhough some rules
    - Predictive Scaling use machine learning  to predict traffic
    - Scheduled scaling


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
