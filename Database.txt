RDS (Relational Data Service):
  - Supports severals engines (MySql, Oracle...)
  - Amazon RDS is available on six database engines, which optimize for memory, performance, or input/output (I/O).
  - For RDS, Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database
  - There is no standby available while using read replicas
  - In case of infrastructure failure, you have to manually promote the read replica to be its own standalone DB Instance, which means that the database endpoint would change
  - Read Replicas are used for improved read performance ad disater recovery
  - can also place your read replica in a different AWS Region closer to your users for better performance
  - Multi AZ enhancing the availability and reliability of your system, however, by itself, multi-AZ cannot be used for disaster recovery
  
Aurora Serverless:
  - Is an enterprise-class relational database
  - Helps to reduce your database costs by reducing unnecessary input/output (I/O) operations
  - OLTP Store
  - Row based

Dynamo DB (Serverless):
  - Dont need EC2 instances
  - Tables is a place to store data
  - Data are orgneized in itens e each item, have atributes. Atributes are differents filters on data
  - Dont nedd to worry about scalling the system
  - Redundantly
  - No-Sql
  - is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
  - Schemaless
  - Usefull as machine learning model store

RedShift:
  - Data wharehouse as a service
  - Scalable
  - Faster the traditional databases
  - it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using standard SQL
  - Analytical processing
  - high-performance storage, and massively parallel query execution
  - RedShift Spectrum can query on S3 buckets
  - OLAP store
 
DMS (Database Migration Service):
  - Migration existing database into AWS
  -  Secure and easy
  - The source and target do not have to be the same type
  - On-premises, EC2, or RDS to EC2 or RDS
  - Different types needs AWS Schema Converter
  
Athena:
 - simply point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL
 - no need for complex ETL jobs to prepare your data for analysis
 - Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage
 
AWS ElastiCache:
 - allows you to seamlessly set up, run, and scale popular open-Source compatible in-memory data stores in the cloud.
 - retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores
 - popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores, Gaming, Geospatial Services, Real-Time Analytics, and Queuing
 - cannot be used for online analytical processing
 
AWS Glue:
  - fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics
